# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game declares a winner when a player successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Features
- Two-player game: Players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on the board.
- Winner declaration: The game declares a winner if a player gets three of their marks in a row.
- Draw condition: If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- Interactive UI: Simple and interactive user interface built with React.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
